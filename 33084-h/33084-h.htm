<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>For several years beginners in the Angora goat industry
were without text books, and even to-day there
are very few practical treatises. From our forty years
of experience in farming Angoras, and from the personal
observations of our Dr. W. C. Bailey, while in
the interior of Asia Minor, we have tried to select the
essential points in the successful management of
Angora flocks, and to present these points so that
they may be used.</p>

<p>We have given a brief outline of the history of the
Angora goat, but we have devoted several pages to
consideration of detail in breeding and kidding. It
has been our aim to make this a practical text book
for the beginner in the Angora industry, and if it
proves of value to him, it has fulfilled its mission.</p>

</div>

<p><img src="images/image4.jpg" style="text-align: left" height="59" width="60" title="A" alt="A" />s to the origin and early history of the
Angora goat little is known. It is supposed
that the Angora variety descended
from one of the classes of wild goats,
and different writers have contended that different
genera were the foundation of the Angora species.
They have based these claims upon the characteristics
of the horns, the covering of the body, shape and size
of the animal, and various other details. Several
agree that Capra Ã†gagrus is the class of goat from
which the Angora species has developed.</p>


<h3>KNOWN FACTS.</h3>

<p>Present history traces the Angora goat to the
vilayet of Angora, in Asia Minor, and to the country
immediately surrounding this vilayet. Some have
set a date over two thousand years ago, claiming that
the Angora goat was introduced into Asia Minor at
that time, but the only authentic history is that given by
Tournefort, a French naturalist, employed by his government,
who explored Asia Minor about two hundred
and fifty years ago, and who described and pictured
the Angora goat about as he appears to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8">8</a></span>
and by Evliya Effendi, a Turk, who wrote in 1550
of the goats, and by a few other writers. That they
have not changed more is due to the fact that the
Turk is quite content as he is, and he has no ambition
to breed a different goat from what he has had for at
least the past three centuries.</p>

<h3>ASIA MINOR.</h3>

<p>Before we consider the migrations of the Angora
goat, we will investigate the physical conditions
of their native province. The interior of Asia
Minor, or the Angora goat country, is from one to
four thousand feet above the sea level. Low, rolling
hills and broad plains, treeless and almost waterless;
dry, hot and desolate in the summer, and covered
with more or less snow in the winter, form the habitat
of the Angora. A small fine fibered sage brush is
the principal diet of the goat, both summer and winter,
but in the spring this diet is supplemented with
weeds and some grass, and in the summer some of
the goats are driven to the higher mountains, where
there are some scrub pines and other varieties of
brush. There is no winter feeding. The goats make
their own living on the tops of the sage brush, which
protrude through the snow.</p>

<p>The indolent Turks do make some provision for
the shelter of themselves and the goats in the winter.
If a cave can be found it is divided so that the goats
share the quarters with the humans. Sometimes an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9">9</a></span>
adobe house is so arranged that the goats and other
livestock occupy the lower part of the house and the
natives the upper part, or if there be but one floor, a
low fence is run across to keep the livestock out of
the living quarters. Great greyish-white wolfish
looking dogs, wearing formidable collars of sharpened
spikes go with the shepherds during the day
and watch the flocks during the night. They are
used as a means of protection from thieves, and not
as an aid in herding. The flocks camp around the
cave or hut, and are not confined in corrals. Fences
are almost unknown in the Angora country. There
are probably four or five million Angora goats in Asia
Minor. Much of the central plateau region of the
United States is very similar to the Angora region of
Turkey. A peculiar fact is that the mohair produced
in the different sections of Asia Minor varies
a little, and the mohair merchants of Constantinople
readily recognize an appreciable difference in its
market value. Even the smaller merchants in the
country recognize a difference in the mohair grown
within a few miles of their town. Some try to explain
this by a difference in food, others by slight
climatic changes, and still others by the soil formation.
Some of the goats from the locality of Geredeh,
in the province of Kastamouni, have fleeces
which are filled with grease. They are as black and
gummy as merino sheep. This mohair, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11">11</a></span>
scours white. The most marketable mohair comes
from Beibazar and Eskischehr. That this difference
in the quality of the mohair is not entirely due to
climate or food conditions is evidenced by the fact
that Angoras taken from Beibazar to California still
retain the same qualities in the mohair after four
years in California. However, it has been noticed
that different parts of the United States produce
different qualities of mohair.</p>

<h3>ANGORA GOATS IN THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>The history of the Angora goat in the United
States dates from 1849, when Dr. James B. Davis, of
Columbia, South Carolina, was presented with nine
choice animals by the Sultan. The Sultan had requested
President Polk to send a man to Turkey who
understood the culture of cotton. Dr. Davis was appointed,
and upon his return to America the Sultan,
as a courtesy, presented him with the goats. For
many years after their arrival in the United States
these goats were considered cashmeres. Early reports
about the fleeces and the goats were erroneous,
and many were led to believe that the fleeces from
these goats were worth $8 per pound, and that the
goats would shear from six to eight pounds per year.</p>

<p>Dr. Davis did not do very well with the goats. He
crossed his Angora buck onto some of the native
common goats, and sold some of the cross-bloods and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12">12</a></span>
possibly some of the original importation to various
parties, but in 1854, Col. Richard Peters, of Atlanta,
Georgia, secured most of the Davis goats. To Col.
Peters really belongs the credit of keeping the Angora
breed in existence in the United States up to the
early sixties. Col. Peters was very fond of his Angoras,
and he continued to own and run them up to
the time of his death. He made a very creditable
exhibit at the New Orleans World's Fair in 1885.</p>

<h3>THE CHENERY IMPORTATIONS.</h3>

<p>W. W. Chenery of Belmont, near Boston, Massachusetts,
is supposed to have made the next two
importations in 1861. No one seems to know exactly
how many goats Mr. Chenery imported or what became
of these lots. Mr. Thompson quotes the Massachusetts
Ploughman as saying, "The first of the
two lots, consisting of thirty nine animals, was shipped
from Constantinople on the 26th of March, 1861,
and arrived at Boston on the 15th of May, except two
animals which died on the passage. The second lot
consisting of forty one head, left Constantinople on
the 6th of October, 1861, and arrived at Boston on
the 25th of November with the loss of only one on
the voyage. In the whole flock, eighty in all, there
were about a dozen males, and all the animals wintered
well."</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that Mr. Chenery made
another importation in 1866, of about twenty head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13">13</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14">14</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BROWN AND DIEHL IMPORTATION.</h3>

<p>The next importation of practical importance, although
it was claimed that nine head were received
about 1861, by one Stiles, was made by Israel S. Diehl,
a former U.S. consul and C. S. Brown, of Newark,
New Jersey, about 1868. Mr. Diehl was commissioned
by the United States government to investigate
the industry in Turkey, and he secured a lot of
Angoras, variously estimated at from one hundred to
one hundred and sixty head. Mr. C. P. Bailey furnished
the money for the transportation of these
goats to California. He says, "Some were fairly good
and some were only ordinary. They were of medium
size, and with the exception of the neck, tolerably
well covered with fleece, which however had a scattering
of kemp throughout. They were conceded
to be the best brought to California up to that time."
Some of these bucks had been tampered with and
were sterile.</p>

<h3>EUTICHIDES IMPORTATION.</h3>

<p>This shipment followed the Brown and Diehl
importation, and consisted of between one hundred
and fifty and two hundred animals. A. Eutichides,
was a native of Turkey, and claimed that he had some
fine goats, but he had an immense amount of trouble
with his Angoras, and lost a good many. They were
held in Virginia for some time, and then were sent to
Sacramento, California, and were afterwards sold by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15">15</a></span>
the express company, at public auction, at very low
prices. This was about 1873. It was generally believed
by old California breeders that some of the
goats offered at this sale were cross-bloods of California
origin. The blood of this importation, however,
has been widely scattered over the Pacific Coast.</p>

<h3>THE HALL AND HARRIS IMPORTATION.</h3>

<p>In 1876, John S. Harris, of Hollister, California,
returned from a perilous journey around the world
in quest of new Angoras. He found the Thibet
goats in the Himalaya Mountains, and finally succeeded
in getting some goats at Angora, in Asia
Minor. He secured two bucks and ten does, and
brought them safely to California. That was really
the first time an American had entered Asia Minor
to study the Angora industry, as it was understood
Mr. Diehl had secured Turks to go into the interior
for him.</p>

<h3>THE JENKS IMPORTATION.</h3>

<p>This was a small importation of Angoras, supposed
to have been three animals, made by C. W.
Jenks of Boston, and sold to Col. Peters of Georgia.
They were supposed to have come from Geredeh, in
the interior of Asia Minor, and they arrived in the
United States in 1880. The mohair from these goats
was not considered very good, and the importation
was not regarded as very important.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16">16</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SHULTS IMPORTATION.</h3>

<p>This was the first importation made from South
Africa to the United States and arrived in 1886. There
were two bucks and two does, and they went to Fink
&amp; Company, of Texas. There was a great deal of
question about this importation, and so far as is known
it was of no value to American flocks.</p>

<h3>THE C. P. BAILEY &amp; SONS CO. IMPORTATIONS.</h3>

<p>In 1893, the first importation of Angora goats
from South Africa, which was of value to American
flocks, arrived. The two bucks, Pasha and Dick, which
were secured by C. P. Bailey from R. Cawood, were
sired by the great buck Sam. Mr. Schreiner says,
"Sam was born in 1888, and sheared as a three year
old, at twelve month growth, 15 pounds 2 ounces. He
was exhibited for many years at all chief Agricultural
shows and was never beaten but once, a judgment
reversed at a subsequent show in the same year. Sam
was the most famous goat in South Africa; with
splendid weight of fleece, he combined a fineness of
fiber rarely seen in an old ram."</p>

<p>Pasha developed into a great sire and his get has
been distributed into nearly every State in the Union,
Canada, Mexico and Australia. Without doubt Pasha's
blood courses through the veins of more Angoras
than any sire ever imported. He was acknowledged
by every one to be the best individual ever brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18">18</a></span>
to America. Mr. Landrum, who had seen most of the
Angoras brought from Turkey and who saw Pasha at
San Jose, California, in 1899, pronounced him the
most perfect goat he had ever seen and a much better
goat than any which had ever come to America from
Turkey. He bought some of Pasha's get for his own
flock.</p>

<span class="caption">ANGORA BUCK PASHA.<br /><br />Bailey South Africa Importation 1893.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1899, the buck Capetown was imported by Mr.
Bailey from South Africa to secure certain points.
Size and a little "yolk," together with the covering,
fineness, freeness from kemp, ringlets and evenness
were especially desired. Capetown has been a great
sire and is still in fine condition on the Bailey farms.</p>

<h3>THE ASIA MINOR GOATS.</h3>

<p>In 1901, Dr. W. C. Bailey, armed with an honorary
commission from the United States Department
of Agriculture, personally visited every goat-raising
section of Asia Minor, and after seeing hundreds of
thousands, and examining minutely hundreds, secured
and succeeded in exporting two bucks and two does.
The Sultan had passed an edict in 1881, prohibiting
the export of these animals, as he hoped to keep the
industry for Asia Minor. The undertaking was a
hazardous one, and the expedition was fought with
many and almost insurmountable difficulties. Asia
Minor is alive with bandits, and to hold a foreigner
for ransom is a favorite pastime. Then, too, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20">20</a></span>
Christian's life is not considered of much value by a
Mohamedan. The goats were transported for miles
on mule and camel back, carried across the Bosphorus
under a boat load of hay, disfigured by shearing and
powdered with coal dust, transported through the
streets of Constantinople in closed carriages protected
from police molestation by the "golden wand," and
finally condemned by the Italian Government because
no health certificate accompanied them from point of
shipment, but eventually landed in California in 1901.
The bucks Beibazar and Kjutiah, and the does Moholitch
and Eskischehr find the climate of California
suited to their wants. These four goats cost over
$5,000 landed in California.</p>

Minor, March 7, 1901, while the goats were held by a Turkish guide.</span>
</div>

<p>Beibazar impresses his qualities markedly on his
offspring. His get won the Sweepstake prizes at the
California and Oregon State Fairs in 1904, and the
championship for two-year-old buck at the World's
Fair at St. Louis, U. S. A., in 1904.</p>

<h3>THE LANDRUM IMPORTATION.</h3>

<p>In 1901, Wm. M. Landrum imported two bucks
from South Africa. Their get has been quite widely
distributed in America, and has been of considerable
value.</p>

<h3>THE HOERLE IMPORTATION.</h3>

<p>In 1904, G. A. Hoerle imported about one hundred
and thirty head from South Africa. A few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22">22</a></span>
these goats were exhibited at the St. Louis World's
Fair, and some of them have been distributed to
American breeders. A large part of them are now
in New Jersey, and just what their effect will be on
American flocks remains to be seen.</p>

<h3>ANGORA GOATS IN SOUTH AFRICA.</h3>

<p>In 1838, Col. Henderson made the first importation
of Angora goats into South Africa, but while
the number reaching the Cape was fourteen, yet only
two proved to be perfect animals, a doe and her kid.
The twelve bucks seem to have been tampered with,
and they would not breed. Mr. Schreiner says: "But
for the fact that there were several million Boar goats,
thoroughly accustomed to the country, to furnish innumerable
ewes for grading up purposes, the industry
would still have been in its infancy." It was
years before any more Angoras were imported into
South Africa.</p>

<p>The second importation into Cape Colony was
made by Messrs. Mosenthal in 1856, and thirty Angoras
reached their destination. Mr. Schreiner reports
that some of these goats were sold at public
auction and brought about $350 to $400 each.</p>

<p>The third importation was made by Sir Titus
Salt, the English manufacturer of mohair, and arrived
in South Africa in 1857. Dr. White had
charge of these after they reached the colony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23">23</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image10.jpg" width="600" height="388" alt="image10" title="image10" style="border: 2px solid" />
<span class="caption">CAPETOWN.<br /><br />Bailey South African Importation, 1899.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24">24</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth importation consisted of about thirty-five
animals, and was made about 1858 by Mr. W. R.
Thompson. These were considered very fine animals,
and were quite different from any previously imported.</p>

<p>Ten years later in 1868, another importation was
made by South Africa and from then on to 1880 between
twelve and fifteen more lots were secured, some
of them consisting of hundreds of animals. In the
twelve years, up to 1880, over three thousand goats
were received in South Africa from Asia Minor.
Some of them brought as high as $2,200 each.</p>

<p>During the next fourteen years there was a lack
of importations into the Colony. In 1894, the first
lot of American Angora goats, six head, were secured
from C. P. Bailey of San Jose, California. They were
sold to the Cape farmers by the importers at satisfactory
prices, and in June, 1895, another lot of
twenty bucks were secured from Mr. Bailey for $1000
cash. These bucks had a hard trip, and shed their
fleece, but they were sold by the importer later.</p>

<p>In 1895, another importation of one hundred and
sixty-five head were secured by consent of the Sultan
from Asia Minor. In 1896 another importation of
sixty-three head were landed and sold to the Cape
farmers. The highest priced buck of this lot
brought about $1,850, and the highest priced doe
about $1,000. These goats were not considered extra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25">25</a></span>
with the exception of a few of the tops. They
were not uniform, the breeches were bad, bellies
deficiently covered, and they carried considerable
kemp.</p>

<h3>ANGORAS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.</h3>

<p>Even before the arrival of Angora goats in South
Africa they had been tried in Holland, France and
England. Australia also imported some in 1856, but
the industry has not grown to any extent in any of
these countries. There have been some Angoras exported
to Australia from America since 1900. Canada,
Mexico, Alaska, and some of the Pacific Islands,
have small flocks of Angora goats at the present
time. The start has been obtained largely from California.</p>

<p><img src="images/image14.jpg" style="text-align: left" height="60" width="60" title="T" alt="T" />hat part of the fleece of the Angora
goat, which at a year's growth is composed
of long, lustrous, elastic fibers,
is called Mohair. It may be more or
less curled, but it is readily distinguishable
from that part of the fleece of the Angora which
is composed of short, stiff fibers, known as kemp.</p>

<p>The word mohair probably has its origin in modern
times, as the Turkish word for mohair is
tiftick. A theory which is advanced by Mr. George
Gatheral of Constantinople, and which is tenable, is
that the early Dutch traders who visited Angora,
found the native clergy wearing a gown made of mohair.
The Turks called the cloth "mahr," and it is
possible that the traders applied this word to the raw
material. If this be so, the English have corrupted
the word into the present term mohair.</p>

<p>The color of mohair varies in different localities
and on different individuals. In the vilayet of Koniah,
in Asia Minor, is a breed of goats producing a
brownish colored mohair. This material is sold upon
the market as Koniah mohair. The Koniah goat, however,
has been rapidly disappearing, as the herdsmen
found that the foreign demand was for white mohair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27">27</a></span>
and they have been crossing the white Angora bucks
on the brown Koniah does. There are still over one
hundred thousand pounds of Koniah mohair produced
each year. In the Angora flocks of Asia Minor one
always finds some colored goats. Black, blue, brown
or red, usually with an admixture of white, are the
common colors. The same thing may be said of the
American flocks of Angoras. One may have been
breeding white Angoras for years when, without apparent
cause, a colored kid is dropped. Then color
of the soil may give the mohair a peculiar tinge, but
this usually scours out. The kemp in Asia Minor
is sometimes a different color from the mohair. The
kemp may be red or black and the mohair white.
White mohair is what the manufacturer wants. If
he wishes to make colored goods, he can dye white
whatever color he wishes, but a colored mohair can
only be used for certain colored goods.</p>

<h3>GRADES AND GRADING OF MOHAIR.</h3>

<p>In Turkey, after the fleece is shorn, the owner
packs each fleece separately in sacks. He picks out
the tag locks, colored fleeces or objectionable mohair,
and after washing it, or making it more fit for market,
he packs this in a sack by itself. Every village
has its buyers, usually Greeks or Armenians, and
there are a few traveling buyers. These men gradually
collect the mohair. Men who have more money<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28">28</a></span>
than they need put that money into mohair, as mohair
is always salable, and it is so bulky that there is
not much danger of it being stolen. There are so
many robbers in Turkey that nothing is absolutely
safe. One coffee house keeper in a small village sent
about six dollars down to a larger place, as he was
afraid to keep so much money in his house. When
the mohair is collected in the larger towns it is again
sorted, care being taken not to mix lots from different
sections of the country. It is then forwarded
to Constantinople of Ismidt, which is on the Sea of
Marmara, near Constantinople. Here expert sorters
go over the lots again. They do not break up the
fleece, but they collect fleeces which are about the
same and from the same district&mdash;for instance, Beibazar,
Kjutiah, Kastamonia, Eskischehr, etc. These
fleeces are then packed in bags and marked x&nbsp;-&nbsp;xx&nbsp;-&nbsp;xxx,
or lettered a, b, AA, or numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. The
mohair is then ready for exportation. It can be
readily seen that a manufacturer who wants a particular
kind of mohair can get exactly what he wants,
if he knows the kind of mohair which comes from
the different districts, and the grade of mohair which
is put up under a certain mark by a certain firm. He
can order of Mr. B. one hundred bags XX Beibazar
mohair, and he knows what he is going to find when
he opens the bags. There is a large room in Constantinople
where a gang of men are almost constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29">29</a></span>
at work sorting mohair. The commission
men have their store rooms around this central room;
when the sorters finish with Mr. A's lot they commence
to sort for Mr. B. Thus the same men sort
all the mohair, and this insures a uniformity of grade.</p>

<p>In America the plan of handling is somewhat
different. It will be easier to tell what should be
done than what is done. Until each grower becomes
something of an expert sorter, or until we have central
depots, where the mohair can be properly graded,
the grower should roll the fleeces separately; they
should not be tied, and put them in a bag or bale.
He should pick out the tag locks, mohair discolored
or clotted with urine or fÃ¦ces, the colored fleeces,
burry mohair or very kempy fleeces, and after preparation,
put them in a separate parcel. Any kind of a
bur or seed which sticks in the mohair must be
picked out by hand. If the manufacturer has to do
this, he puts a price on the mohair which will leave
him plenty of margin. That is, he pays the grower
about one-half as much as the mohair would be worth
if it were free from this foreign material. If the
mohair is very burry, it has to be treated chemically,
and this spoils the luster. Sometimes the grower
can make good wages by having the burs picked out
before the animals are shorn. One man can pick the
burs out of from fifteen to twenty-five animals a day,
if there are not too many burs in the mohair. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30">30</a></span>
tag locks can be cleaned sufficiently by washing, they
are of some value; but if not, they are hardly worth
the expense of shipping.</p>

<p>The mohair shorn from kids should be kept in
parcels by itself, as it is usually finer and worth top
prices. That of the does, if it differs from that of
the wethers, should be packed separately. When the
mohair is received by the mill it is sent to the sorting
room.</p>

<h3>SORTING BY THE MANUFACTURER.</h3>

<p>Each goat's fleece is made up of a variety of different
grades of mohair. Before a fleece can be spun
it must be separated into these different grades as
nearly as possible, and this is done by expert sorters,
who select from the raw material about seven different
degrees of fineness of fiber. They also take into
consideration freeness from kemp and color. In
separating the fleece much dust is liberated, and as
some mohair is liable to carry the bacillus of anthrax,
or other dangerous material, this dust, if allowed
to circulate in the air, would become a serious
menace to the health of the sorters. Wool sorters'
disease is by no means uncommon, and one of the
American mill owners reported that his sorters had
such a dread of a foreign mohair which came packed
in a distinctive package, that he had to stop handling
this particular lot, although it was profitable stuff to
spin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31">31</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image15.jpg" width="600" height="352" alt="image15" title="image15" style="border: 2px solid" />
<span class="caption">MOHAIR TRANSPORTATION IN CONSTANTINOPLE, TURKEY.<br /><br />Photo taken by Dr. Bailey.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32">32</a></span></p>

<p>To obviate this danger as far as possible each
man opens the fleeces on a table covered with wire
screen, under which circulates a strong exhaust current
of air which is mechanically generated. Thus
small foreign particles and dust in the fleeces are
drawn downward. When the fleece is opened the
sorter selects that part of the fleece which is
known to be the coarsest, <i>i. e.</i>, the breech and a strip
along the center of the back, and puts this in one lot.
Next he selects a narrow strip along the side of the
fleece, which is known to be the finest part of the
fleece, and puts this in another lot. Now the neck
and the belly are separated and thrown into their
classes. If the whole fleece were a fine one, and free
from kemp, it would be sorted in the same way, but different
parts of the fleece would go into proportionately
higher classes. The lots which these sorters make
are known to spin comparatively definite qualities
of yarn. Thus the low breech and the back of most
fleeces will not spin over No. 20 to No. 24 yarns, and
the sides of good fleeces are fine in fiber and will
spin No. 40 to No. 60 yarn.</p>

<p>The quantity of mohair which one man can sort
varies considerably, according to the class of mohair
which he is given to work upon. One mill estimated
that experts can sort between two and three hundred
pounds of domestic mohair a day, and that it costs
about a cent a pound to thus separate the fleece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33">33</a></span>
After the fleeces are graded, the mohair is ready to
be sent to the mill proper for scouring and spinning.</p>

<h3>SCOURING.</h3>

<p>To-day the process of washing or scouring the
fleece is done by machinery. The mohair is fed into
a machine in which revolve paddles, which thoroughly
mix the fiber with the liquid in this machine. At
the opposite end from where it was fed in, the
mohair is rolled out over warm rollers, and it is ready
to be spun. It is claimed, and with some justice,
that American mohair loses or shrinks about 12% to
20% while passing through this washing machine,
and that Turkish mohair only shrinks about 13%.
This may be due to the fact that some of the Turkish
hair had been washed before it was shipped to market,
and that by previous sorting some of the dirt had
fallen out of the mohair. Then, too, some of the
American growers are not very careful to keep the
fleeces clean. Straw, sticks, hats, and even stones
have been found in some domestic stuff.</p>

<h3>MIXING.</h3>

<p>After the mohair is thoroughly cleaned it is
ready for spinning or carding. In order to spin the
fibers most economically, evenly and to the best advantage,
some of the mills mix different qualities of
mohair of about the same fineness. For instance,
Turkish mohair is mixed with Texas and California<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34">34</a></span>
stuff, or Oregon is mixed with Iowa material. The
spinning qualities of mohair from different sections
varies, and this mixing tends to give uniformity.
After the fibers have been mixed to suit, the mohair
is run through straightening machines in preparation
for the combing process.</p>

<h3>FIRST OR NOBLE COMB.</h3>

<p>This comb is so arranged that about two and a
half inches of the base of all of the mohair fibers,
and any other fibers which may be mixed with them,
are held, the ends of the fibers which are longer than
two and a half inches, hang freely and are caught in
a revolving machine and dragged loose from the
combs which hold the base of the fiber. Thus only
those fibers two and a half inches long, or less, are
left in the first comb. The longer fibers, or tops as
they are now called, to distinguish them from the
noil, or short fibers, are collected and are again
passed through a second comb.</p>

<h3>SECOND OR LISTER COMB.</h3>

<p>Much the same process as was gone through with
in the Noble comb, is repeated, except that now
only the Noble top is combed, and as all of the fibers,
less than two and a half inches, have been removed
from this mohair, the comb is set so that any fibers
shorter than four or five inches, shall be held as noil,
and only those fibers which are longer than four or five<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35">35</a></span>
inches shall be included in the top. This combing
completed, we have a collection of mohair fibers
none of them less than about five inches in length.
This top is now ready to spin. This combing is rendered
necessary by the fact that all of the mohair contains
an admixture of kemp, and kemp cannot be spun
with the finer grades of mohair. In getting this kemp
out of the mohair many of the short mohair fibers
are lost, so that combing is an expensive process. It
costs in time, labor and mohair.</p>

<h3>SPINNING.</h3>

<p>Many strands of this Lister top are now drawn
down into a single thread. This thread, if the fibers
comprising it are coarse, may have some projecting
ends, which give it a rough, uneven appearance, and if
so, these ends are burned off. The thread is passed
through a gas flame at a given rate of speed by machinery,
and the projecting ends are singed. This is
called genapping. The yarn is now ready for manufacturing.
In Bradford, England, there are mills
which only spin the yarn. Their trade is with the
manufacturers, both at home and abroad, and it is
a known fact that, while France and Germany manufacture
much plush and braid, they buy all of their
yarn from Bradford.</p>

<h3>CARDING.</h3>

<p>Short mohair, that is, mohair less than six inches
long, is not run through combs, as above described.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36">36</a></span>
It is run over a carding wheel, or a large metal cylinder
covered with small brads, which mix all the mohair
and kemp. After passing over a number of
these wheels, which revolve in different directions,
the material thus carded is ready to spin.</p>

<h3>NOIL.</h3>

<p>Some of the noil collected by the combing process
is composed of a large percentage of short mohair.
This noil has a considerable value and is sometimes
carded. The lower grade noil is sold to carpet
manufacturers and various users of low grade stuff.
Noil usually brings from twelve to twenty cents a
pound.</p>

<h3>USES OF MOHAIR.</h3>

<p>As yet mohair has been used for only a limited
number of things. Its possibilities have not been developed.
New uses for the fiber are being discovered,
and it seems probable that there will be
many things made of mohair in the future. The
yarn has a beautiful luster and is very durable.
When ladies' lustre goods are in fashion a large
amount of mohair goes into these fabrics. Much
mohair is used in dress goods and men's goods.
There is a steady demand for mohair plushes and
braids.</p>

<p>There is no plush made which will give the service,
present the luster and retain a standing pile as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37">37</a></span>
long as mohair. One may crush the nap of a mohair
plush as often or as long as he pleases, but the pile
immediately resumes its upright position upon being
released. Then, too, the dust shakes out of a mohair
plush very easily. One rarely sees a dusty railroad
car seat, although the country through which the car
is passing may be very dusty. The rich effect produced
by a heavily upholstered palace car is due to
the mohair plush. Nothing has been found which
will take its place. For furniture upholstering there
is nothing more elegant and durable than mohair
plush. The amount of plush thus used is governed by
fashion. In countries where large military forces are
retained there is always a heavy demand for mohair
braids. There is no braid made which has the luster,
combined with the durability, which mohair braid possesses.
Here it may be stated that a coarse yarn can
be used in making braids, so that when there is a
heavy demand for braids there should be a proportionately
high price paid for coarse long mohair. Mohair
braids are always in demand, and will continue
to be used upon ladies' clothing, as well as for military
ornamental purposes.</p>

<p>The variety of uses to which mohair is adapted
is almost innumerable. In the manufacture of hats
it plays an important part, and recently the demand
for long fiber for the manufacture of wigs, ladies'
hair nets and other toilet articles has been created.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38">38</a></span></p>

<h3>WORLD'S SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION.</h3>

<p>At present Asia Minor and South Africa can be
regarded as the two leading producers of mohair.
The Asia Minor exports vary considerably, according
to the price allowed, and as no manufactured stuff is
exported, one gets a fair idea of the amount produced.
It may be broadly stated that the Asia Minor clip
amounts to about nine million pounds annually.
That of South Africa amounts to about ten million
pounds, and the United States now produces about
one million pounds annually. Of this production a
very large percentage of that coming from all these
countries may be regarded as inferior stuff. We
mean by this, that the Angora goat raising industry
is yet in its infancy, and that much of the mohair
produced is sheared from goats which have been
bred from the common hair variety. Many of the
characteristics of the fleece of the common goat still
persist in the mohair.</p>

<p>From the foregoing estimate the world's supply
of mohair may be stated as twenty million pounds
annually. Australia is as yet producing only a very
small amount.</p>

<p>Practically eighty-five to ninety per cent. of the
world's supply of mohair is handled in Bradford,
England. Nearly all of the South African and
Turkish stuff is shipped directly to Bradford, a small
amount of the Constantinople export coming to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39">39</a></span>
America, but a large part of the American import
comes from Liverpool, England. At Bradford the
raw material is manufactured, some of the manufactured
stuff being exported as yarn, but the larger
part is used to produce the finished article. The remaining
ten or fifteen per cent. is manufactured in
the United States. At times the demand for mohair
goods stimulates the demand for raw material, and the
United States has been known to use from twenty to
twenty-five per cent. of the world's supply. To recapitulate,
the United States produces five per cent.
of the world's annual supply of raw mohair, and
manufactures from ten to twenty-five per cent. of the
world's annual production.</p>

<h3>MOHAIR PRICES.</h3>

<p>The price of mohair has fluctuated with the
caprice of fashion. Supply and demand are the
essential factors in its valuation, but demand has
been so influenced by the requirements of fashion in
the past that one finds a wide range in price for the
raw material. In a report issued by the Bradford
<i>Observer</i> we find the price ranging from fifty cents a
pound in 1856, to eighty cents in 1866, ninety cents
in 1876, and then down to thirty cents in 1886 and
1896. In 1903 the average price in the United States
was about thirty-five cents a pound, and for 1904
about thirty cents a pound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40">40</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image16.jpg" width="600" height="361" alt="image16" title="image16" style="border: 2px solid" />
<span class="caption">READY FOR THE SHEARERS.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41">41</a></span>To-day there is a demand for mohair, regardless
of fashion. During the past two years the price of
raw material has been low, but there has been a margin
of profit in the industry, and considering the fact
that fashion's decree has eliminated the manufacture
of luster fabrics for the present, the mohair producer
can feel assured that there will be a steady market
for his material. With the occasional good times
when luster goods are in demand, the mohair grower
should do well.</p>

<h3>SHEARING AND PACKING MOHAIR.</h3>

<p>The goat should be shorn before he commences to
shed, as the mohair loses its weight and luster after
the shedding process begins. There are a few goats,
which, under certain kinds of food and climatic conditions,
will not shed their fleeces, but most goats
will shed, and even goats which have carried their
fleeces over a year in one section, may shed if they
are moved a few miles and the food is changed. A class
of non-shedders would be very valuable, but so far a
distinctive class of non-shedders, under any and all
conditions, and which transmit this peculiarity, has
not been identified. The Angora goat will usually
commence to shed early in the spring, or as soon as
a few warm bright days come.</p>

<p>In some sections of the country it is thought advisable
to shear twice a year. Many points in favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42">42</a></span>
of this method are advocated. It is claimed that the
price realized for the two medium length, or short
stapled fleeces, together with the increased number
of pounds shorn in the two clippings a year, pays
much better than the one long staple fleece which can
be shorn from the same animal for a year's growth.
There are many reasons both for and against shearing
twice a year. The mills prefer long mohair, or
at least fiber more than six inches in length (combing
length). They pay the best price for this class of
mohair, and it must be left to the individual to decide
whether it pays him best to shear once or twice a
year. At present possibly one-third of the Angoras
in the United States are shorn twice a year, and the
remaining two-thirds only once. In Asia Minor one
finds the goat shearer using a pair of long bladed
scissors to cut the mohair. The goats are shorn in
the spring, and only once during the year. The animal's
feet are tied, and then by using both hands, one
at either end of the scissors, the goat is shorn. Recently
some Englishman has introduced an ordinary
spring sheep shear, but most of the natives prefer the
scissors.</p>

<p>To-day one finds the hand shearer and the machine
shearer at work in America. The hand shearer
should use a pair of short bladed (about five inch
blade) sheep shears. This is to prevent the point of
the shear from cutting mohair, which is not intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43">43</a></span>
to be clipped with that particular stroke of the shear.
If, for instance, the shearer is clipping the mohair
along the sides of the animal, and the point of the
shear cuts some of the mohair at least three inches
out from the body, this stubble is shorn again (double
cut) when the shearer gets to this place, and this
three-inch mohair is too short to be of much value.
It will be combed out at the mill as noil. An expert
shearer can clip about the same number of range
goats that he can range sheep&mdash;from ninety to one
hundred and twenty a day.</p>

<p>The machine shear is rapidly taking the place of
the hand shear. It clips the mohair close to the
skin and almost does away with double cutting. It
requires less skill to shear with a machine shear, and it
does the work more uniformly. There is also less
danger of cutting the animal. The machines do the
work very rapidly.</p>

<p>After the goat is shorn the fleece should be collected
and rolled into a bundle, "bump," and placed
in a sack or bale. It should not be tied, as the mill
men object to the particles of string which remain in
the mohair and disfigure the manufactured product.
Any colored fleeces, discolored mohair, or mohair containing
objectionable features, such as burrs, straw,
etc., can be placed in separate parcels. The kid mohair
can be kept by itself, and the wether and doe
mohair can be separately packed. The long mohair<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44">44</a></span>
should be kept separate from short stuff. Thus one
grades the mohair to some extent on the farm, and
he has a better idea of what the clip should bring.</p>

<p>If the mohair is to be shipped a long distance, it
will pay to bale the fleeces, as compact bales occupy
much less space than sacks. The freight rates are
usually less upon baled mohair than they are upon
the sacked material. The cost of baling the mohair
is a little less than the cost of sacking.</p>

</div>

<p><img src="images/image19.jpg" style="text-align: left" height="60" width="59" title="O" alt="O" />ne can learn very little about breeding
the Angora goat from the Turk. As
we know from Tchikacheff's work,
which was published over fifty years
ago, cold winters often killed many of the Angoras
in Asia Minor, and the Turk then imported from
more favored districts common bucks or does to breed
to the Angora. This was before the great demand
for mohair, occasioned by the increase in manufacturing
plants at Bradford, England, caused the Turkish
mohair raisers to resort to all manner of means
to increase the supply of raw material.</p>

<p>To-day the Turk is treading in the paths of his
forefathers. What was good enough for them, certainly
ought to be good enough for him, so he reasons.
He eats with his fingers, cooks on a brazier, sits on
the floor, eats, drinks, sleeps and works all in the
same room, and keeps his wives in seclusion.</p>

<p>When he comes to breeding the Angora he leaves
that to his servants, if he be wealthy enough to have
any. Most of the breeders cannot read or write. They
have never traveled. They have no ambition, and they
know nothing of the principles of selective breeding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46">46</a></span>
As a natural consequence the Angora goat of to-day
has not improved, nor is he likely to improve under
Turkish management. One large breeder who supplied
bucks to some tributary country, said that he thought
that it was a shame to castrate a buck, no matter how
bad he might be. The Turk separates the bucks
from the does at breeding season, as Asia Minor has
cold weather late in the spring, and the danger of losing
kids, if they come too early, is great. When the
bucks are turned with the flock they are allowed to
run until the next breeding season, and all of the
bucks, regardless of quality or quantity, are allowed
to run with the does.</p>

<p>When the first few Angoras arrived in America
the natural procedure was to cross them upon the
common short-haired goat of this country. It was a
new industry, and many wanted to try the Angora.
Very slowly the Angora, or the cross-bred animals
were scattered over the United States. Stories were
told of the wonderful things for which the mohair
was used, and some supposedly reliable authorities
quoted mohair at $8.00 a pound, as has been stated.
Companies were started, and of course the supply of
good Angoras, that is, goats which would shear about
four pounds of mohair (worth at that time about seventy-five
cents or a dollar a pound), was limited.
Men bought any goat which had a trace of Angora
blood in him as a thoroughbred Angora. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47">47</a></span>
years, however, demonstrated the fact that a common
goat, with a little admixture of Angora blood, did not
produce either the quality or the quantity of fleece
wanted. Only a few of the more persistent breeders
continued the experiment and their investigations.
They sent and went to the home of the Angora, and
brought more of the original animals to America. It
took the American breeders about thirty years to find
out just what the Angora goat was and how he should
be handled. During that thirty years large flocks of
common goats, which had been crossed with the Angora,
and which might be properly termed "grade
flocks," had been formed. Only a few thoroughbred
flocks, that is, flocks of the original Angora, as he
came from Turkey, were in existence.</p>

<h3>CROSSING WITH THE
COMMON SHORT HAIRED GOAT.</h3>

<p>By experience we have learned that the common
short coarse haired goat can be crossed with the Angora
goat, and that after sufficient crosses have been
made, the cross-bred Angora so nearly resembles the
thoroughbred that for all practical purposes he is an
Angora. We have also learned that certain kinds of
common goats respond rapidly to the infusion of Angora
blood, and that others retain certain peculiarities
of the common goat for generations. The Angora
will not cross with sheep. For instance, a common
goat with a long mane on the back, or tuft of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49">49</a></span>
long hair behind the foreleg, or on the flank or the
hip, will continue to perpetuate this long coarse hair on
the offspring for generations, even though the best of
Angora blood be infused. The color of the common
goat is of some importance. A brown or reddish brown
goat retains the reddish cast at the base of the mohair
much longer than one of a bluish or bluish
black color. It is equally true that a pure white
mother may drop a colored kid occasionally. In
Constantinople the mohair is graded into parcels containing
red kemp, black kemp, etc. There it is the
kemp which retains the color. As has been stated,
there is also a breed of brown Angora goats, or at
least mohair-producing goats, in Koniah in Asia
Minor. Presuming, then, that one has a suitable
common doe and a good Angora buck as a basis, the
following may be deduced as relative changes in the
different crosses:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48">48</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">PASHA V&mdash;A True Breeder.</span>
</div>

<p>The first cross, or half-blood Angora, will have a
covering of short coarse common hair and a thin covering
of mohair, which does not grow very long. If
the animal were to be shorn, possibly a half pound of
hair of a very inferior grade might be yielded. If
this hair were to be offered to a manufacturer, he
would class it as noil, and refer it to a carpet manufacturer,
who would possibly pay ten or twelve cents
a pound for it. The skin of the animal will be a little
fluffy, and not suitable for fine goat skin trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50">50</a></span>
It will not take a good polish after tanning, and it is
not desirable for shoe leather. It will be worth
about half as much as common goat skin. The meat
of the animal will be a little better than that of the
common goat, but it will be inferior to Angora venison.
The animal will still be as prolific as the common
goat. Twins and triplets will be a common
occurrence. The kids will also be hardy. If one
were to stop at this stage in breeding, he would have
decreased the value of the skin of his goat without
increasing the value of the animal.</p>

<p>The second cross, or the three-quarter blood
Angora, will have a covering of short coarse common
hair, especially noticeable on the back, belly, neck
and hips. The mohair will now be fairly thickly set
upon the sides of the animal, and of medium length,
about seven inches long for a year's growth. If the
animal were to be examined by a novice, he would be
called an Angora from his general appearance. If
shorn, he will yield about one, or one and a half
pounds of hair, and the mohair manufacturer will
pay about twelve or fifteen cents a pound for the
material. The skin is valueless for rug, robe or trimming
purposes, because of the coarse back and the
scanty covering of mohair. It is fit for glove leather
after tanning, but its value for this purpose is less
than that of the common goat. The meat is more
like Angora venison, and can be sold on the market<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51">51</a></span>
as mutton. The animal is still prolific. From the
second cross on, the grade goat rapidly assumes
the characteristic of the Angora goat, but if for
any reason poor bucks are used (an occasional animal
without apparent reason retrogrades), the animal as
rapidly resumes the characteristic of the common
goat. Quite a percentage of colored kids will be
dropped by does which are themselves white.</p>

<p>The third cross, or seven-eighths blood Angora,
will still have the coarse back, a partially bare belly,
coarse hips, and the neck will be insufficiently covered.
The sides will be covered with good quality,
long staple mohair, comparatively free from the
coarse, dead underhair, or kemp. The animal will
shear about two or three pounds of fair mohair,
which will be worth from twenty to thirty cents a
pound. This mohair will be fit to run through the
combs, and the "top," or long mohair, free from
kemp, will be used in the manufacture of plushes,
braids, etc. The skin will have some value for rug,
robe and trimming purposes. The meat will be
juicy, palatable and salable as mutton.</p>

<p>The fourth cross, or fifteen-sixteenths blood Angora,
will be hardly distinguishable from the average
thoroughbred Angora. The coarse back will persist
to some extent, and the hip will be plentifully covered
with kemp. A good many of this grade will be
poorly covered on the belly, and an occasional bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52">52</a></span>
necked or off colored animal will be dropped. The
animal will shear from two and a half to five pounds
of mohair of good quality, which will be worth from
twenty-five to thirty-five cents a pound. It will be
from eight to twelve inches long at a year's growth,
and it will be combed at the mill. It is fit for manufacturing
into any of the goods for which mohair is
used. The meat of the animal is rich, juicy, and free
from the disagreeable qualities so often noticeable in
mutton. If the animal be fed upon browse, the meat
will have the flavor of venison. The tendency of
the mothers to drop twins will be lessened, and it
will be rather the exception for twins to be born.
The kids will be rather delicate when dropped.</p>

<p>Subsequent crosses will tend to reduce the
amount of kemp upon the animal and to improve the
back. The question will now resolve itself into one
of breeding for points. Bucks must be selected
which cover the points the does need most, and by
careful selection the grade flock will soon be indistinguishable
from the thoroughbreds.</p>

<h3>METHODS USED IN AMERICA TO-DAY.</h3>

<p>By gradual steps the original Angoras imported
into America have been so improved, and the cross-bloods
have been so highly graded that some of the
American flocks equal the best Turkish flocks.
America has many high-grade flocks, which, if it were
not for the remaining coarse hair of the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53">53</a></span>
goat, would be upon a par with the Turkish flocks.
There are enough good goats in the country for a
foundation stock, and a few years more of the careful,
painstaking, selective breeding which is in progress
throughout the United States to-day, will bring forth
an Angora superior to the Turkish stock. Sections
of the country modify the characteristics of the Angora.
Probably climatic conditions, varieties of food
and water, and certainly mental vigor of the owners
is largely responsible for this. One man selects
large, well formed, rapidly maturing goats and breeds
for this type. It is surprising how soon his flocks
assume this type. Another breeder works for fineness
of fleece, regardless of size or shape of the animal,
and he gets his points.</p>

<p>There has been much vagueness as to what points
the breeder should try to produce. Some have
claimed that the most profitable animal to raise was
one producing heavy ringletty fleece, regardless of
the quality of the fleece, except of course that it
should be as free from kemp as possible. This day
has passed. We know what the mohair is used for,
and know how it is prepared for manufacturing.
The future may change these uses or methods, but
we know what we want now, and we know how to
breed our goats to produce the most money per head
for the present at least. Fashions vary, and the
fashions vary the demand for certain grades of mohair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54">54</a></span>
Coarse fibered, long staple, fine luster mohair
possessing a great amount of tensile strength and elasticity
will make good braid yarns, but if braid yarns
are not in demand, such fiber is not the best for plush
or dress yarns. Fine fibered, long staple, pliable,
lustrous, easily spun yarn can be used for braid stuff,
or at least part of the fleece will be heavy enough for
this purpose, and the finer parts have such a variety
of uses that they spin yarns which are always in demand.
Looking at the question from the manufacturing
standpoint, we see that the most staple product
is the fine-fibered mohair. But a producer might have
animals which would shear two and a half pounds
average (the average of the Turkish flocks) of very
fine mohair, while another grower might have animals
which would shear four or five pounds average of
coarse mohair. And even though the value per pound
of the coarse mohair may be considerably less than
that of the fine mohair, the grower owning the coarse
haired heavy shearing Angoras will realize more
money per head for his clip. The value also of the
carcass and skin of the Angora is of importance. A
heavy carcass and a large skin are of more value than
a light carcass and a small skin.</p>

<p>If the Angora breeder would produce the animal
which will yield the most money per head, he
should aim to produce an animal which will shear
the heaviest fleece of the most marketable mohair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55">55</a></span>
regardless of fashions, and one which, when put upon
the market, will dress the most possible pounds of
desirable meat, and yield a readily marketable skin.
There are not many such animals on the market to-day,
but the time when there will be plenty is
coming. We have the fineness of fiber; we have the
density of weight of fleece; we have the covering of
the animal and the size and stamina of the individual,
and we have breeders who are endeavoring to
unite combinations to produce the Angora of the
future. But while we are without the ideal, one
should choose that point which is hardest to attain,
most necessary for the best paying animal, and work
especially for that. That point is fineness of fiber,
always remembering freeness from kemp. There
are many large goats, many heavy shearing goats,
but there are very few fine fibered comparatively free
from kemp goats. One should not make the mistake
of neglecting size and weight of fleece. There are
few animals which will respond more rapidly to careful
crossing than the Angora goat. A buck will
usually stamp his individuality upon every kid, hence
the necessity of carefully selecting breeding stock.</p>

<h3>GESTATION.</h3>

<p>The period of gestation varies slightly with the
individual, but the average may be approximately
stated as one hundred and forty-seven days, or about
five months. Both the bucks and the does have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56">56</a></span>
breeding season, but this season may be changed or
varied by different elements. As a rule the bucks
commence to rut about July or August here in
America, and the does soon after the time the bucks
commence. Some bucks which have been allowed to
run with the does all of the time, never cease rutting,
and the does conceive about every six months. The
does come in heat about every fourteen days, and remain
in this condition for about three days. If the
bucks are allowed to run with the does, one buck should
be used for about every fifty does. If the buck is only
allowed to serve the doe once, a grown animal will
serve one hundred and fifty does in forty days without
permanent injury to himself. The does conceive at
about the age of seven months, and the bucks breed at
about the same age, but the wise breeder will not
sacrifice the individual by interfering with its development.
Both the buck and the doe should not be
bred until they are at least a year old. The bucks
should be fed at breeding season, and if one has
a sufficient number of bucks, it is well to turn the
bucks with the does in relays. It is advisable to have
the kids start coming slowly, so that one may get
new men trained to handle them properly. One or
two bucks turned with a flock of a thousand does for
a few days, and then removed and allowed to rest,
and a new relay of three or more bucks turned with
the does, to be removed in a few days, and a new relay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58">58</a></span>
being introduced into the flock, will do more satisfactory
work than they would if all of the bucks
were turned in at one time. The same principle can
be applied to smaller flocks. The does should be
protected from cold storms or rough handling when
they are heavy with kid, else they are liable to abort.
If for any unusual cause the doe aborts one season,
there is no reason why she will not carry her kid until
full term another time, and experience has proven
that she will.</p>

</div>

<h3>BREEDING OF REGISTERED STOCK.</h3>

<p>The breeding of registered stock, or stock of
known ancestry, requires much care and quite different
handling. Both the does and the bucks must be
marked with an ear tag, brand, tattoo number, or
some other permanent individual mark, and the kids
should be marked at birth. Fifty known does may
be put in a pasture or pen and a known buck put
with them. He should be allowed to run with them
at least forty days. After this the does may be collected
into a flock and several bucks turned with
them, but only the kids which are dropped from a
known buck are fit for record.</p>

<p>A more accurate method, and one which can be
used with a large flock, is to place the bucks in a corral
adjoining the one used by the does at night. The
does should be brought into their corral early in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59">59</a></span>
evening, and all of those in heat will work along the
fence next to the bucks. The doe in heat can be
caught and the number taken and recorded in a book.
She is then placed in a small pen with a buck and
his number is recorded with hers, together with the
date. If the doe does not conceive, she can be put
with the same buck again at a later date, and one has
approximate knowledge of when she should drop her
kid. In this manner a buck will serve about two or
three does in the evening, and one or two in the morning.
The kid is marked at birth and the number recorded
after that of the mother. The breeding of recorded
stock is of value only for special reasons, and
is not advisable with large flocks, as it is expensive.</p>

</div>

<p><img src="images/image25.jpg" style="text-align: left" height="60" width="59" title="A" alt="A" />ngora venison is the name which should
be given to the flesh of the Angora
goat. At the present time it is usually
sold in the markets as mutton. The
term goat meat should be applied to
meat of the common goat, and the term mutton belongs
to sheep. Because the Angora goat feeds largely
upon that material which nourishes the deer, the meat
of the Angora is flavored like venison. The fat is
well distributed, and the healthfulness of the animal
renders this an especially desirable meat. The Turk
has long recognized Angora venison as an important
element in his diet. Angora kid is above comparison,
and it occupies the principle place on the menu at
private as well as state affairs in the Orient. As one
passes through the market places in Asia Minor
he sees the carcasses of the Angora hanging in every
shop. There is no mistaking the animal, as the skin
still remains on the goat. One takes his choice, and
as a rule more Angora venison than mutton is sold.
Some of the Turks keep their wethers until they become
coarse-haired and too old to pay to keep longer,
eight or ten years old. This class of meat ranks
with old mutton, and sells at a discount. Young<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61">61</a></span>
wethers and does are in good demand. There has
existed in America some prejudice against the flesh
of the goat. To-day thousands of goats are being
consumed annually, but most of them are sold as
mutton. Packers and butchers still insist that Angora
venison must be sold as mutton. They pay
about one-half a cent to a cent a pound less for the
goat than for sheep.</p>

<p>The goat never fattens as well along the back as
the sheep, and hence the carcass does not look so
well. The fat is more evenly distributed throughout
the animal in the goat. An expert once said that to
know whether a goat was fat one should feel the
brisket, and if there was a considerable layer of adipose
tissue between the skin and the breast bone, the
animal was fat.</p>

<p>Some of the American breeders do not send
their wethers to market until they get too old to produce
valuable fleeces. The animals are then slaughtered
when they have grown a half year's fleece, and
the skins are reserved by the breeder. These skins
are valuable, and help to bring up the average price
of the goat.</p>

<p>At present some of the packers recognize no difference
between shorn and unshorn goats. The
price is the same, so it pays to shear the goats before
bringing them to market. There is absolutely no
strong flavor in prime Angora venison, and this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62">62</a></span>
where the meat differs from that of the common
goat.</p>

<p>The goat is a slow grower, and not until the second
year do the bones ossify. Therefore, a two-year-old
can be sold for lamb, as he has a "soft joint."
Grown Angora wethers do not average much more
than one hundred pounds as a rule, although there
are occasional bands sold which average one hundred
and fifteen pounds.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that Angora venison will never
supplant mutton, but it will have its place among the
edible meats.</p>

</div>

<p><img src="images/image25.jpg" style="text-align: left" height="60" width="59" title="A" alt="A" />n Angora goat skin differs considerably
from the skin of the common goat.
In the first place the Angora skin is
covered with more or less mohair;
and in the second place, the texture
of the skin itself is different. The skin of the
common goat is firm, and the different layers are so
closely united that they cannot be separated. The
layers of the Angora skin are not so closely united,
and the skin is slightly fluffy. The outer layer of
this skin peels off when it is used. The Angora skin
is valuable both with the fleece on and without it.
Its principle value, however, is with the fleece on.
After the skins have been properly tanned, they are
used for rugs, robes, trimmings, and imitating various
furs. When ladies' and children's Angora furs are in
style, these skins become very valuable for this purpose.
One skin has cut $17.00 worth of trimming at
wholesale. Of course, the value of the skins depends
upon the quality and character of the mohair with
which the skins are covered, and their size. Large,
well covered skins are always scarce and command
good prices. They are worth from $1.00 to $2.00 each.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64">64</a></span>
Most of the Asia Minor skins are sent to Austria, and
the prices paid for the raw skins are about the same
as in America. The skins which have had the mohair
removed are valuable for the manufacture of gloves
and morocco leather. They do not make as fine leather
as the common goat skins, but they are as extensively
used. All skins should be carefully handled.</p>

<p>The skin should be carefully removed from the
carcass. Goats do not skin as easily as sheep, and
the careless operator is liable to cut the inner layers
of the skin if he is not careful. These cuts are called
"flesh-cuts," and skins badly "flesh-cut" are comparatively
valueless, because "flesh-cuts" can not be removed
by the tanner. A sharp knife should be used,
and the operator should avoid cutting the skin.</p>

<p>The skin should be well salted, care being taken
to see that the salt penetrates every portion of the raw
surface. The skins can be cured in the shade without
the use of salt, but sun-dried skins are worthless.
If the edges of the skin are allowed to roll, so that
raw surfaces come together, the part so affected will
heat and the hair pull out. It is not necessary to
stretch the skins while curing them.</p>

<p>Goats should be killed when their fleece is suitable
for robe and rug purposes. Those carrying a six
month's fleece, if it is six inches long, have about the
right kind of skins. There are some Angora skins
imported from Turkey and South Africa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65">65</a></span></p>

<p><img src="images/image31.jpg" style="text-align: left" height="60" width="63" title="T" alt="T" />he Angora goat should not be classed
with milch animals. As a rule the does
give a sufficient amount of milk to
nourish the kid or kids. The more
common blood there is in the goat the
better milch animal she is. However, some Angoras
have been milked, and the milk is as rich as that of
the common goat. A quart of milk a day may be
considered a fair average for a fresh milch Angora
doe. It has been suggested that because the milk of
the goat contains a heavy percentage of fat, it is a
proper substitute for mothers' milk for babies. This
is probably a mistake, as that part of the milk which
is the hardest for the baby to digest is the protein, and
it will be observed that in the following table of
analysis submitted, the percentage of protein in
goat's milk and in cow's milk is about the same, and
that it is considerably larger than in mother's milk.
A very desirable feature in goat's milk is that the fat
is distributed throughout the milk, and that it does
not readily separate from the milk. This would
assist in the assimilation of the fat by an infant.
Some experiments made with coffee demonstrate that
it requires half the quantity of goat's milk to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67">67</a></span>
the same effect upon this beverage which cow's milk
produces. This may be partially explained by the
quantity of fat in goat's milk, and partially by the
fact that the fat does not readily separate from the
milk. The bottom of the can is as good as the top.</p>

<p>Persons in poor health have been greatly benefitted
by the use of goat's milk. This is probably
due to the fact that the fat in the milk is so distributed
that a large percentage of it is taken up by the
digestive apparatus. Angora goats are docile, and it
is possible that some of them could be developed into
good milch animals.</p>

<h3>FERTILIZER.</h3>

<p>It is a known fact that packers of the present
day utilize all of the carcass of most food animals,
but it is not the fertilizer which the packer makes
from the blood and offal of the goat which we shall
consider here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68">68</a></span></p>

<p>Sheep's manure has been used for years on orchards
and vegetable gardens, and in the last few
years goats' manure has been in demand, selling at
from $6 to $7.50 a ton, depending upon the purity of
the fertilizer. It must be remembered that only a
small portion of this manure is dropped at the night
bed-ground, the balance is evenly distributed over the
land upon which the goats are feeding. The goats not
only rid the farm of objectionable weeds and brush,
but they help to furnish a rich soil in which grass
will grow. This fact has been so thoroughly demonstrated
that western farmers, who have large tracts of
wheat or barley stubble to rent during the summer,
are always anxious to get goats upon this land.</p>

United States the Angora has had
a variety of food. He is a natural
browser, and will live almost entirely
on brush, if this kind of food is
to be found, but he readily adapts himself to circumstances,
and will live and do well upon an exclusively
grass diet. The fact that the goat is a browser has
been made use of in clearing farms of brush and objectional
weeds. If a sufficient number of goats are
confined upon a limited area for a period of time,
they will kill most of the brush upon this land.
They will eat almost every kind of brush, but they
have their preferences and enjoy especially blackberry
vines and those kinds of brush which contain
tannic acid, such as scrub oak. They do not poison
easily, and if there is a variety of food they rarely
eat enough of any kind of poisonous plant to prove
fatal. If, however, they are hungry, and have access
to places where there are poisonous plants, they will
eat enough to kill themselves.</p>

<h3>KILLING BRUSH.</h3>

<p>If one wishes to clear brush land, he should confine
the goats to a comparatively small tract. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70">70</a></span>
goats kill the shrubs by eating the leaves and by
peeling the bark from the branches and trunks of the
trees. The brush thus deprived of lungs, soon dies
and the roots rot. As fast as the leaves grow they
must be consumed, so it is well to allow the goats to
eat most of the leaves off of a limited tract, and then
in order to give the goats plenty of feed, they should
be moved to another field. As soon as the leaves on
the first tract have regrown the goats should be again
confined to this land. In this way the leaves are continually
destroyed. This process can be continued
as fast as the leaves regrow. By this method it is
estimated that a bunch of one hundred to one hundred
and fifty goats will clear forty acres of thick
brush in about two years. In countries where the
grass grows as the brush dies, goats will eat some of
this grass, but they prefer the browse.</p>

<p>On some of the older goat ranches, where the
Angora has been raised exclusively for the mohair
and mutton, it has become quite a problem to prevent
the goats from killing out the brush. The goats
have done well where other kinds of livestock would
have starved, but as soon as the brush is killed the
land produces almost nothing, and even the goats cannot
make a living. To prevent as far as possible
their killing the brush the flocks are moved frequently
from one range to another, so that the shrubs
have a chance to recuperate between visits. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71">71</a></span>
way brush can be kept almost indefinitely for the
goats. On some of the western ranges, where cattle
and sheep have, by continual cropping, killed much
of the grass, good browse remains. These ranges
would have to be abandoned if it were not for the
goat. Goats do not in any way interfere with the
pasturage of cattle or other livestock. Cattle feed
contentedly on the same range with the goats, and
this fact has led many southern cattle men to invest
in goats. The goats are herded on the brushy lands,
and the cattle range over the same territory and eat
the grass. Horses have a great fondness for goats.</p>

<h3>SALT.</h3>

<p>Goats, like other livestock, should have a small
amount of salt. The salt should be kept where they
can get it at liberty, or else it should be fed at regular
intervals. If ground salt is given, care should be
taken to see that individuals do not eat an oversupply
of the salt.</p>

<h3>WATER.</h3>

<p>While Angoras do not require as much water as
sheep, yet they should be given a quantity sufficient
at least once a day. In winter goats will live upon
snow. Men have reported that their goats have gone
for a week at a time, and all summer long, without
any more moisture than they could get from browse<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72">72</a></span>
and weeds, but even if Angoras should stand this
treatment, they will thrive better with water once
daily. It is estimated that under normal conditions
a goat will consume about one-ninetieth of its
body weight (about a pint of water for a grown animal)
in a day. On hot days, when the animals are
on dry feed, they will frequently drink two quarts of
water.</p>

<h3>SHEDS.</h3>

<p>To raise Angora goats most profitably one should
really be provided with sheds. These sheds should
be about the same as those which are provided for
sheep in the same locality. For years southern and
western breeders have made a success of the Angora
industry, and very few of them have had any artificial
protection for their goats. But even these
breeders find that they can raise a larger percentage
of increase, and get through the year with a smaller
percentage of loss if they have sheds. Grown goats
rarely need much shelter, even in the winter, if the
weather is dry, but during cold, damp storms the
fleece wets through and the animal chills. Just after
shearing, or just before kidding season, one is liable
to lose some grown animals, or to have many kids
slunk, if the goats are not protected from cold storms.
Young kids also require attention, and proper sheds
more than pay for themselves by preventing excessive
mortality. Whether the shed should be closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73">73</a></span>
on all sides, or whether it may be left open, depends
upon the locality. Do as one would for sheep, under
the same conditions, will be a fairly safe rule to follow.
Allow at least four or five square feet of shed
room to each mature animal, and the danger of the
goats crowding together in the corners and smothering
the animals on the underside of the pile, should
never be forgotten. On very cold nights large numbers,
especially of the kids, may be killed by smothering,
if they are not carefully watched.</p>

<h3>FENCES.</h3>

<p>The question of fencing for the Angora goat is
not such a serious matter as the beginner would imagine.
If the goats have not been raised as pets and
taught to jump, there will be little trouble with the
animals going over a perpendicular fence of ordinary
height. They will, however, go through or under
the fence, if it is possible. They are natural
climbers, and if the fence offers projecting steps,
upon which they can climb, they will soon find their
way to the outside of the enclosure. Some of the
old stone and rail fences will not hold goats. Any
perpendicular fence, three feet high, with transverse
spaces not wider than three or four inches for the
lower two feet, and not wider than six inches for the
upper foot, will hold goats. If the spaces in the
fence are perpendicular, they will necessarily have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74">74</a></span>
be narrower, as small kids will crawl through the
spaces. A woven-wire fence, two feet high, with a
perpendicular stay, at least twelve inches apart, so
that the goats will not get their heads caught in the
fence, surmounted by a couple of plain or barbed
wires, six inches apart, will hold goats, and if barbed
wire is used, will prevent cattle from breaking the
fence. If plain or barbed wire is used, the first
three wires nearest the ground should be placed not
more than three inches apart, and close enough to
the ground to prevent kids from crawling under the
lowest wire. The space between the next wires may
be increased to four, five and six inches, and so on
to the desired height of the fence. A board fence
composed of three boards four inches wide, with a
space between the ground and the first board of
about three inches, and a three or four inch space between
the boards, the whole being surmounted by a
barbed or plain wire or two makes a very satisfactory
goat fence. If pickets or posts are used, they should
be set closely enough together, say about two inches
apart, to prevent small kids from crawling between
them. An objection has been raised to barbed wire,
on account of the mohair which the barbs pull out.
The amount of mohair lost in this way is inconsiderable.
As has been stated, it hurts the goat to pull
the mohair, and the goat soon learns to avoid the
barbs. Many breeders use barbed wire corrals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75">75</a></span>
find them satisfactory. Probably woven wire is the
best fence under ordinary conditions.</p>

<h3>HERDING.</h3>

<p>In mountainous countries, where it is not practical
to fence the range, the flocks should be watched by
herders. The Angora has a natural tendency to return
home, or to a known camping ground at night, and
in some places this tendency is relied upon to bring
the flock home, and they are not herded. Of course,
in countries where there is no danger from loss by
depredations of wild animals, and where food is so
plentiful that the goats must find a sufficient amount,
the flock may be turned loose.</p>

<p>One shepherd should tend from one to two
thousand head, as goats flock together well. Of
course, during kidding season the flocks will have to
be more closely watched. Goats travel rapidly and
cover a considerable amount of territory in a day.
A flock may travel from ten to twelve miles from the
time they leave camp in the morning until they return
to camp in the evening. The herder should
walk ahead of the leaders of the flock, so that they
will not travel too fast, or he may walk upon a nearby
elevation, so that he can see that the flock does not
separate. A flock will sometimes string out over a
mile. The goats should be given freedom. Too
often a zealous herder overworks himself and keeps
his flock poor by crowding them together. A good<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77">77</a></span>
sheep herder soon learns the nature of the goat, and
when he understands the animal he would rather
herd goats than sheep.</p>

</div>

<h3>DOGS.</h3>

<p>In some sections of the country sheep-killing
dogs have proven a great nuisance to sheep-breeders.
To say that the Angora goat will prevent dogs from
killing sheep, and that they will drive the dogs away,
would be a misstatement. Bucks and grown goats
will protect themselves to some extent. If a strange
dog attacks a flock in a field, the goats will usually
huddle together and the bucks and grown animals
will keep the dog at bay. A mother will fight bravely
to protect her kid.</p>

</div>

<p><img src="images/image25.jpg" style="text-align: left" height="60" width="59" title="O" alt="O" />n experience of years has taught the
Turk that if he wishes to save many
kids, he must have them come late in
the season. The changeable weather of
the Turkish spring, the frequent cold
rains and the lack of proper shed accommodations,
have more than once not only destroyed the increase,
but also killed the grown goats. The Turkish methods
of handling kids are of little practical value.
They know how delicate the kids are when they
are born, and they usually bring the kid and its
mother to the house as soon as it is dropped.</p>

<p>The Turkish Angora goat men usually range
small flocks, and they also have a surplus of help, so
that this is a comparatively easy method. The kids are
allowed to go with the flocks as soon as they are old
enough to travel. The principal objection to letting
young kids go with the flock is that the kids go to
sleep, and sleep so soundly that the flock feed away
from them. When the youngsters awake they are lost.
If there be wild animals about, the kids may be killed,
or they may starve before they are found. The
Turk, however, has so many herders with one flock<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79">79</a></span>
that they usually discover the kids before the flock
has strayed.</p>

<p>In America the kidding season is the most important
time of the year for the Angora breeder. If
he would raise a large increase, he must be properly
prepared, and he must be constantly alert. If the
weather be fair, with bright sunshiny days and
temperate nights, the kids will do well without much
care, but if it be cold, stormy and muddy, some of
the kids will be lost in spite of all care. After the
kids are born the mothers should have such food as
will produce the greatest amount of milk. Well-fed
mothers make strong healthy kids. Green feed is
desirable.</p>

<p>The proper season, then, for the kids to come
will depend upon the climate and range conditions.
Allowing for the period of gestation, which is about
five months, the bucks can run with the does as early
or as late as one wishes. One can be guided somewhat
by the time sheep men allow ewes to lamb.
When the first warm weather comes the goats usually
commence to shed their mohair, and as it is too early
in the season for the kids to be dropped, the does must
be shorn before kidding or the mohair lost. Care
should be exercised in handling the does heavy with
kid. For the first few days after shearing the doe
should not be allowed to chill, as she may abort. In
some countries it is possible to kid before shearing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80">80</a></span>
but there is no practical objection to shearing before
kidding, provided proper care be exercised.</p>

<h3>HANDLING OF KIDS.</h3>

<p>There are various methods in use of handling
the young kids, and all of them are intended to save
as large a percentage of increase as possible with the
least possible expense. Almost every man who has
handled goats has some individual idea which experience
has taught him. The locality and surroundings
of the flock make a vast difference in the way
they should be kidded. The method which works
best with fifty or one hundred does in a fenced brush
pasture in Oregon or Iowa, would be useless with a
flock of a thousand or fifteen hundred in the mountains
of Nevada or New Mexico, where there is often
no corral to hold the goats.</p>

<p>With a bunch of from fifty, to two hundred and
fifty, and a shed big enough to hold the entire lot, it
is not difficult to raise a very large percentage of kids.
If the does are kept in a ten or twenty-acre pasture,
they should be allowed to run out and take care of
themselves as much as possible. The doe may drop
her kid wherever she may happen to be, and she will
almost invariably take care of it and coax it to the
shed at night. The refusal of a young doe to own
her kid must be overcome, especially if the weather
is unfavorable. The mother must be caught and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81">81</a></span>
milk forced into the kid's mouth until he learns to
suckle. After he has been sufficiently fed, place
them together in a box stall and leave them for a
day or two. Then, in all probability, the mother will
take care of her kid.</p>

<p>The box stall is about three feet square and three
feet high, with a little door on hinges to save lifting
the animal. A row along the inside of the shed next
to the wall is a great convenience. A doe with her
kid should be disturbed as little as possible, because,
as a rule, she knows how to care for her kid better
than a herder.</p>

<p>When goats are handled on a larger scale, with no
pasture available, entirely different methods should
be adopted&mdash;for the mother must go out to feed every
day and the kid cannot go.</p>

<p>Probably the most extensively used methods are
the "corral method" and the "staking method,"
either used individually or combined.</p>

<h3>THE CORRAL METHOD.</h3>

<p>In the corral method, two or three large corrals
and numerous smaller ones are necessary. First, the
does should be separated from the wethers, if they have
been running together, and a "wether band" made.
Then every morning the "doe band" must be looked
over carefully for does that will kid during the day.
Such does must be put in a corral by themselves and
allowed to kid in this corral. They should be fed some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82">82</a></span>
hay, or if that is not possible, they should be herded
near by for a few hours. It has been our experience
that most of the kids will come between the hours of
ten in the morning and four in the afternoon. The
more does which one can pick out in the morning the
better it is, for the doe, after dropping her kid, is
allowed to stay with it the rest of the day and all
night. In this way she learns to know it. If one has
hay to feed the doe, so that she may be left with her
kid for one or two days, it is a great advantage.</p>

<p>After all the does have been selected which can be
found, still some will be overlooked, and they will
go out on the range with the rest. The best way to
handle these is to have the herder make a straight
drive to a certain point where the feed is good, and
then stay around this one place, allowing the kids to
come within as small a radius as possible without
starving the goats. If it is necessary, quite a distance
can be covered in this way, and yet the kids
will not be scattered over a large section of the
country.</p>

<p>As a kid is dropped, the doe should be allowed to
remain with her kid and take care of it until evening.
The herd will gradually feed from them, but it should
be kept as near as possible to protect the kids from
wild animals. Towards evening one must go out
and gather up the kids and drive the mothers to the
corral. The large herd should be driven home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83">83</a></span>
advance, keeping a little apart from the does with
kids so as not to coax the "wet does" away with the
"dry herd."</p>

<p>When the wagon with the kids reaches the ranch,
the kids should be put in a small corral. They
should be placed a few feet apart, and the mothers
should be allowed to select their own kids. They
also should be allowed to remain in the corral for the
night at least. In case a doe will not take her
kid she should be placed in one of the box stalls and
a kid which has no mother placed with her and fed.</p>

<p>When plenty of small corrals and good hay are
available, each day's kids should be left in a separate
corral until the mothers have been with the kids one
or two days. It will be found that the kids are
always given a very good start in this way. When it
is deemed advisable, the kids are put together in a
large corral, and as soon as the mothers in the
smaller corrals are thought to know their kids sufficiently
well, they are added to this wet band in
the large corral. Thus the round is completed from
the dry band to the wet band, the small corral being
simply an intermediate step to insure familiarity between
the doe and her kid. The dry band rapidly
diminishes while the wet band increases.</p>

<p>The mothers are now ready to go on the range
during the day to feed, but the kids should be kept in
the corral until they are at least six weeks old. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85">85</a></span>
does may be turned out over a "jump board" placed
across the gate. A jump board is a two-inch plank,
eighteen inches high, with a four-inch strip nailed on
the top for the does to put their feet on as they jump
over. The kids come to the board but cannot get
over. If some of the larger kids bother by trying
to get over, some one can stand at the gate to scare
them back by pounding on the board with a stick.
The does will soon learn to pay no attention to the
noise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84">84</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image37.jpg" width="600" height="470" alt="image37" title="image37" />
<span class="caption">THOROUGHBRED ANGORA DOE.</span>
</div>

<p>Even now there will be a few kids which will not
be mothered. Every morning, before the wet band is
allowed to go over the jump board, one should walk
through the herd, pick out the kids that have not
been nourished during the night, and select does that
are not suckling kids. These does should be held
until the kids have been fed. A row of small stantions
is a convenient thing for holding them. After
a kid gets a good start he will steal a living from different
does if necessary.</p>

<p>To kid a band of from one thousand to fifteen
hundred does by the corral method, will require at
least three men&mdash;one man to herd the dry band, one
the wet band, and a man to look after the kids and
assist where needed. Often the wet band is divided,
or when one wet band has reached the number of
from five hundred to seven hundred animals, another
is started.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86">86</a></span></p>

<h3>THE STAKING METHOD.</h3>

<p>The staking method is quite commonly used,
and in certain localities it is probably the best way to
handle kids. The apparatus necessary is a smooth
piece of half-inch board, two inches wide and four
inches long, with a hole bored in each end. Through
the hole in one end a piece of rope eight inches long
is passed, and knotted so that it cannot pull out.
The loose end of this rope is then made fast to a
stout stake which is to be driven into the ground.
Through the hole in the other end a piece of rope
eighteen inches long is passed and knotted as in the
first end, in such a way that the loose end of the rope,
which is to be fastened to the kid's leg, draws
away from the stake. When the apparatus is in use
the small stick with the holes in the ends acts as a
swivel to keep the rope from tangling.</p>

<p>It is important to select a proper place to tie the
kid. He is to stay in this place for about six weeks,
and he needs protection from winds and wild animals,
and should have some sunshine and some
shade. Usually a small tree, a bush, a fence, or a
post will offer a good place to stake. The does which
are expected to kid during the day are separated
from the flock as in the corral method. The balance
of the band are herded, so that the kids dropped on
the range can be more easily handled. Just as
soon as a kid is dropped, it is taken to a convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87">87</a></span>
place to stake, and the mother coaxed to follow.
One of the kid's legs is securely fastened to the
loose end of the rope, and the kid and its mother are
left together. The mother is thus free to go and
feed, and on returning will know exactly where to
find her kid.</p>

<p>Many owners allow the does which have kidded
to herd themselves, as they usually return to their
kids, often coming in several times during the day.
Of course this necessitates having plenty of food and
water within access of the staking ground. The
wet band could be herded as in the corral method.</p>

<p>In this staking method if a mother refuses to
own her kid, or if she dies, the kid has no chance to
steal milk from some other wet doe, and unless
closely watched, quite a number of kids will starve.
The rope should be changed from one leg to the
other occasionally to allow symmetry of development.
The preparation of ropes and stakes for a thousand
kids is quite a task, and it keeps the energetic herder
busy during his spare moments getting ready for kidding
time.</p>

<p>For the first few days the Angora kid is full of
life and vigor as any animal of like age. If he be
well nourished, he will frisk and play at all kinds of
antics, until he is so tired that he must forget everything.
The sleep which comes is so sound that any
usual amount of noise does not disturb him. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88">88</a></span>
this characteristic which makes it unsafe to take kids
on to the range with a flock. The kids are liable to
hide behind some bush, go to sleep and be lost.</p>

<h3>CASTRATING.</h3>

<p>Before the kids are allowed to go out with the
flock the males should be castrated. The Turk does
not alter the males until they have developed sexuality
and the male horn, <i>i. e.</i>, the heavy characteristic
buck horn. He then castrates by either removing
the testicles, or by twisting or destroying the spermatic
cord. When the latter method is used the testicles
and cord undergo an inflammatory process
which destroys the regenerative power of the animal.
The testicles remain in the scrotum apparently unchanged.
The animal thus treated presents to the
casual observer the physical characteristics of a buck.
The Turk claims that an animal treated in this manner
is less liable to die than one whose testicles are
removed. This is probably true, as the initial lesion
produced by the operation is very small, and there is
less liability of infection.</p>

<p>The usual method employed in this country is to
remove the testicles before the regenerative power of
the animal is developed. This gives the wether a
feminine appearance, and there is comparatively little
danger of death if the operation is properly performed.
It will be easiest to castrate the kids be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89">89</a></span>tween
the age of two and four weeks. The kids
should be driven into a small clean corral, and after
undergoing the operation they should be turned into
a large clean enclosure.</p>

<p>The operator stands on the outside of the small
corral, and the assistant catches the kids and turns
them belly up before the operator, onto a board
which has been fastened to the fence. A pair of
clean scissors, or a sharp knife, which may be kept
in a five per cent. carbolic acid solution when not in
use, serve to cut off the distal end of the scrotum.
The testicles are then seized with the fingers and
drawn out. The operator drops the castrated kid
into the large enclosure and the assistant presents
another kid. Two men can operate on sixty kids an
hour. The testicles are slippery and some herders
prefer to use the teeth instead of the fingers to extract
the testicles. Under no circumstances should
any unclean thing be put into the scrotum. Death
usually results from infection, and infection from uncleanliness.
A little boracic acid might be sprinkled
over the cut surface as an additional precaution, but
this is unnecessary if ordinary cleanliness is observed.
If after a few days the kid's scrotum swells,
and does not discharge, the scrotum should be
opened with a clean instrument. Less than one-half
of one per cent. of the kids will die from this operation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90">90</a></span></p>

<h3>RIDGLINGS.</h3>

<p>While castrating the kids the operator will discover
that some of the kids have but one descended testicle.
When these animals are found the descended
testicle should be removed, and they should be recognized
by some distinctive ear mark or brand. These
animals will develop like bucks. It is a disputed question
as to whether they are able to exercise regenerative
power, but they will cover the does, and in some cases
they probably get kids. The undescended testicle
can be removed, but as the testicle usually lies close
to the kidney, and is hard to distinguish from that
organ in the young animal, it is best to delay the
operation until the ridgling is at least six months old.
The instruments necessary for this operation are a
stout rope to suspend the animal, a clean sharp knife,
scissors to remove the mohair from the place to be
incised, and sharp needles threaded with silk. The
knife, scissors and silk should be immersed in a hot
5% carbolic acid solution, and they should be kept in
this solution except when actually in use.</p>

<p>The rope is fastened to the hind legs of the animal
and he is suspended in midair. An assistant
steadies the body of the goat. The operator selects a
place on the loin of the goat, about two or three
inches away from the backbone, below the ribs and
above the hip bone, on the side opposite to that which
the descended testicle occupied. He then shears the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91">91</a></span>
mohair from this part of the goat. The mohair
should be removed from a space at least eight inches
square. A lengthwise incision is then made through
the skin and muscles, or after the skin is cut, the
muscles can be separated with the fingers and the
testicle is found. It usually lies close to the backbone,
to the lower and inner side of the kidney. It is
usually undeveloped and much smaller than the kidney.
Its surface is smooth and not indented like the
kidney. When it is discovered it can be withdrawn
through the opening, and adherent tissue clipped
with the scissors. The muscles and skin should be
brought together with the silk thread. The needles
should pierce the muscles as well as the skin, and the
edges of the skin should approximate. No hair
should be allowed to remain between the cut surfaces,
as the wound will not heal rapidly. After the
wound is closed some boracic acid powder may be
dusted over the wound, and the goat allowed his freedom.
After ten days or two weeks the silk threads
should be cut and drawn out, as they will not absorb,
and they will irritate the wound. If this operation
is carefully performed, and strict cleanliness adhered
to, less than 2% of the animals operated upon will
die.</p>

<h3>GROWTH.</h3>

<p>A kid at birth is usually small and weak, possibly
weighing from four to six pounds. For the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92">92</a></span>
few days of life he grows slowly, but as the organs
adapt themselves to the new life, the kid becomes
strong and grows rapidly. When the kid is born he
is covered with a coarse hair, and it is not until he is
from three to five weeks old that the fine mohair
fibers appear growing between the coarser hairs. The
kid continues to grow gradually, and at three or four
months he weighs from twenty to forty pounds. The
mohair may now be from two to four inches long.
At a year old the Angora goat will weigh from fifty
to eighty pounds, and the mohair may be as long
as twelve inches, or sometimes longer.</p>

<h3>WEANING.</h3>

<p>When does are bred once a year the kid should
be weaned before the doe is rebred. This allows the
doe time to recuperate before her maternal powers are
again brought into active service. Then, too, a doe
nursing a kid through the winter, enters the spring
with a depleted system and produces a poor quality
and small quantity of mohair. The kids should be
weaned when they are about five months old, as this
allows the mother at least two months rest before she
is rebred.</p>

<h3>MARKING.</h3>

<p>There are various reasons for marking goats, and
the methods employed vary as widely as the reasons
therefor. The object in view is to put some mark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93">93</a></span>
identification either permanent or temporary upon
the animal. The ears may be cropped in certain ways,
a brand may be placed upon the nose, or tags or buttons
placed in the ears, or characters tattooed into the
ears. Probably the most permanent mark is the
tattoo, and if it be placed on the inner hairless surface
of the ear, it is as lasting as the tattoo so often
seen in a man's arm.</p>

</div>

<p><img src="images/image40.jpg" style="text-align: left" height="60" width="65" title="S" alt="S" />ome of the older breeders supposed that
the Angora was not subject to any disease,
but as goats have been introduced
into new territory, they have become
affected by some of the same troubles
which bother sheep, but usually to a less degree.
Some of the worst sheep diseases, such as scab, do
not bother goats, but the goat has some special complaints
which do not affect sheep. Very few carcasses
are condemned by the government meat inspectors at
the large packing centers. Tuberculosis is almost unknown.</p>

<h3>LICE.</h3>

<p>Nearly all goats are infested with lice, a small
reddish louse, a goat louse. Lice rarely kills the animal
infested, but they do annoy the goat greatly.
Goats will not fatten readily, and the mohair is
usually dead (lusterless), if the animals are badly infested.
It is an easy matter to discover the lice.
The goats scratch their bodies with their horns and
make the fleece appear a little ragged. On separating
the mohair the lice can easily be seen with the
naked eye. The best means of ridding the goats of
this annoyance is with almost any of the sheep dips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95">95</a></span>
A dip which does not stain the mohair should be
selected. The goats should be dipped after shearing,
as it does not take much dip then to penetrate to the
skin. One dipping will usually kill the lice, but the
albuminous coat covering the nits (eggs of the
louse), are not easily penetrated, and it is usually
necessary to dip again within ten days, so that the
nits, which have hatched since the first dipping,
will not have a chance to mature and deposit more
eggs. Goats can be dipped at almost any time, but if
in full fleece they will require a larger quantity
of liquid, and if the weather is very cold, there is
some danger.</p>

<h3>STOMACH WORMS.</h3>

<p>Stomach worms affect goats, and in some instances
their ravages prove fatal. There are a
variety of these worms, but the general effect on the
animal is about the same. They are usually worse in
wet years. The goats affected become thin and weak.
They usually scour. Sometimes the worm, or part
of the worm, can be found in the feces. These same
symptoms are caused by starvation, so the two should
not be confounded. There are many drenches in use
for the treatment of this trouble, and some of the
proprietary remedies have given some relief. Goats
running on dry, high land are rarely affected.</p>

<p>Verminous pneumonia of sheep may also occur
in goats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96">96</a></span></p>

<h3>FOOT ROT.</h3>

<p>Foot rot is a disease which affects both goats and
sheep, if they are kept on low wet land. It rarely
proves fatal, and can be cured if the cause is removed,
but it sometimes causes a good deal of trouble. The
goats' feet swell between the toes and become so sore
that the animals are compelled to walk on their
knees. It can be cured by carefully trimming the
feet and using solutions of blue stone. Goats should
not be put on wet land.</p>

<p>Sometimes the glands of the neck enlarge, a condition
known as goitre. This is sometimes fatal with
kids, but usually cures itself. There is no known
remedy for it, but it is comparatively rare.</p>

<p>Anthrax, tuberculosis, pleuro-pneumonia and
meningitis, will affect goats, but these diseases are
very rare. Some of the southern goats have swollen
ears, but what the cause of this trouble is no one has
yet determined.</p>

<h3>POISONS.</h3>

<p>There are several plants which will poison goats,
but very little is known about them. Some of the
laurel family are responsible for the death of a good
many goats yearly, and some milk-weeds will kill if
taken in sufficient amount at certain times of the
year. These plants should be avoided as much as
possible. Treatment has been rather unsatisfactory.
If the poisoned animal is treated at once, an active<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97">97</a></span>
purgative may rid the system of the irritant. Epsom
salts and crotin oil have given relief.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image41.jpg" width="600" height="252" alt="image41" title="image41" style="border: 2px solid" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Schreiner describes an epidemic of pleuro-pneumonia
which destroyed many flocks of Angora
goats in South Africa. The disease was effectually
stamped out in that country, and it has never appeared
in American flocks. Mr. Thompson has described
a disease called Takosis, which was supposed
to have caused the death of many goats in the Eastern
States, and along the Missouri River Valley.
Some claimed that this trouble was caused by change
of climate, others thought that it was starvation or
lack of proper care. There is very little evidence of
it now in the United States. All in all, the Angora
goat is the healthiest of domestic animals.</p>

<p>In 1865, Mr. C. P. Bailey started in the Angora
goat industry. There were then very few Angora
goats in the United States, and those in California
had originated from two thoroughbred bucks secured
from Col. Peters of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p>In 1866, Mr. Bailey secured a pair of Angoras
from W. W. Chenery of Boston, Mass. There were two
other pairs secured at this time for other parties, and
these three does were the <i>first thoroughbred does</i>
brought to California. The first two goats cost Mr.
Bailey $1000. <i>The first thoroughbred Angora kid</i>
dropped in California was by Mr. Bailey's doe.</p>

<p>In 1869, Mr. Bailey furnished money to bring
the Brown &amp; Diehl importation to California, with
the understanding that he was to have first choice.
The Angoras secured from this lot were <i>the best goats</i>
which had been brought to California up to that
time.</p>

<p>In 1876, Mr. Bailey selected the best buck of the
Hall &amp; Harris importation, and paid seventy-five dollars
service fee for three of his Brown &amp; Diehl does.
Later he purchased forty-one head from Hall &amp; Harris.
Some of these were the Brown &amp; Diehl goats,
and some from the Hall &amp; Harris importation of
1876.</p>

<p>Twelve years after Mr. Bailey commenced breeding
Angoras, he moved his entire grade-flock, consisting
of about 1000 animals, to Nevada, and maintained
his thoroughbred flocks in California. By careful
selection, rigid culling, and strict attention given<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99">99</a></span>
his flocks, Mr. Bailey had brought them by 1892, to
an excellence beyond any of the imported stock.</p>

<p>In 1893, Mr. Bailey imported two fine bucks
from South Africa. An account of the buck Pasha
will be found in this book.</p>

<p>In 1899, another direct importation from South
Africa was made, and the great sire Capetown was
secured.</p>

<p>In 1901, Dr. W. C. Bailey secured four of the
best Angoras obtainable in Asia Minor, by personal
selection, and added them to the Bailey flocks. This
was the first importation made in America from Asia
Minor for twenty-five years.</p>

<p>During all these years, since 1865, Mr. Bailey
had been constantly at work with his Angora flocks.
There were many hardships to overcome, and most of
the original Angora breeders gave up the struggle.
We honestly believe that if it had not been for his
perseverance the Angora industry would not be in its
present prosperous condition.</p>

<h3>Register.</h3>

<p>We have been keeping a register of our stock,
and this register is the oldest in the United States, or
the world. Animals registered in the Bailey Angora
Goat Record have a universal standing.</p>

<h3>Manufacturers of Gloves, Robes and Trimmings.</h3>

<p>The Angora Robe and Glove Company was established
in 1875, with C. P. Bailey as president. Later
Mr. Bailey secured sole control of this company. We
have been using goat skins and mohair in large quantities
for the last thirty years, and to-day</p>

<h3>WE PAY THE HIGHEST CASH PRICES FOR GOAT SKINS
AND MOHAIR.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100">100</a></span></p>

<h3>Buck Selections.</h3>

<p>From the above history it will be seen that we
have several different strains of bucks to offer, and
the fact that we have taken the Grand Prizes and
highest awards at the New Orleans World's Fair,
1885, Chicago World's Fair, 1893, St. Louis World's
Fair, 1904, and sweep stakes at State Fairs and National
Meetings for the last thirty years, should put
these bucks on the top. We have sold thousands in
United States, and they have given almost universal
satisfaction.</p>

<h3>Does.</h3>

<p>Our thoroughbred does trace their ancestry to
the best stock obtainable. We always have a good
many grade Angora does on the range, and we are
prepared to quote prices on carloads, or small lots.
We gladly furnish information.</p>
